> **Watcher** for watches the changes in the file system, variables and data records.

# Watcher

Watcher is an open source system to automate the detection of changes in the system, facilitating the integration of processes, workflows and the development of monitoring applications.

Detecting changes to the file system or data structures in memory is useful for developers of security applications, resource monitoring or process integration.

## Prerequisites

### Supported platforms

- POSIX Compliant: **Unix**, **Macosx**, **Linux**, **Freebsd**
- POSIX for Windows: **Cygwin**, **Microsoft POSIX subsystem**, **Windows Services for UNIX**, **MKS Toolkit**

### Watcher runs on Tarantool

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Requires **tarantool** >= 1.6.8.0
- Build Requires: **tarantool-devel** >= 1.6.8.0

## Instaling Watcher

### From Utility Tarantool: tarantoolctl

```Shell
tarantoolctl rocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/racherb/watcher/master/watcher-scm-1.rockspec
```

### From LuaRocks

Make sure you have Luarocks installed first, if you need to install it follow the instructions in the following link: https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Download

From the terminal run the following command:

```Shell
luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/racherb/watcher/master/watcher-scm-1.rockspec --local
```

### From Linux Repository

#### Ubuntu

> Precise | Trusty | Xenial | Yakkety | Zesty

```Bash
apt update
apt install watcher
```

## Running the tests

The execution of the tests will take between 3 and 10 minutes approximately. This time is required in the simulation of file generation, modification and deletion.

```Bash
prove -v ./test/watcher.test.lua
```

or

```Bash
./test/watcher.test.lua
```

## Getting Started

Create a watcher to detect file deletion:

```Lua
--Defining file watcher for deletions
fw = require('watcher').file
fw.deletion({'/path/to/file'})
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
