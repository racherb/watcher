Watcher for Watch everything!
=============================

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: Automates file surveillance for process and system integration, monitoring and security, change control and automation.

`Watcher`_ simplifies the integration of non-connected systems 
by detecting changes in data and facilitates the development of monitoring, 
security and process automation applications.
Think of Watcher as an intercom or a bridge between different servers or between different 
applications on the same server. Or you can simply take advantage of Watcher's capabilities 
to develop your project.

"Watch everything" 
    Currently the functionality of detecting changes in the file system is implemented.
    However, the project has a larger scope and we invite you to collaborate with us 
    to achieve the goal of "Watch Everything".
    One step at a time! Come on and join us.

Starting with the file system üóÇÔ∏è
    Yes, we have started implementing watcher to observe and detect changes in the file system. 
    You can use watcher to discover changes related to file creation, file deletion and 
    file alteration. You can find out more about our all the :doc:`/features` in these pages.

Watcher is Free, Open Source and User Focused üíì
    Our code is free and `open source <https://github.com/racherb/watcher>`_.
    We like open source but we like socially responsible software even more.
    Watcher is distributed under MIT license.
